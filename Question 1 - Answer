Problem
=======

Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

#Load Required Libraries

    library(plyr)
    library(ggplot2)
    library(data.table)


    NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
    SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

#Convert into data.table
    NEI.DT = data.table(NEI)
    SCC.DT = data.table(SCC)
    
#Aggreate emission per year
    total.emissions <- with(NEI, aggregate(Emissions, by = list(year), sum))
    
#Open the PNG device
    
    png(filename = "plot1.png", width = 480, height = 480, units = "px")
    plot(total.emissions, type = "b", pch = 18, col = "green", ylab = "Emissions", 
    xlab = "Year", main = "Annual Emissions")
    
# Close the PNG device
    
    dev.off()
    
# png
